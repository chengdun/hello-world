Just my first repository.

Hi everyone!

I'm ChengDun. I want to be a independent developer. I'm now learning "Ruby on Rails". If you want to learn with me or help me that will be awesome.

I'm a Chinese who live in ChengDe. ChengDe is a beautiful city on the north fo China. I love my hometown and my country. If you want to know more about we Chinese and our China, welcome talk to me. I'll show you what chinese like.
